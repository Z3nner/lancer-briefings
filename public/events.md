# Star System: Bright - Approaching planet Kiemene // Late 5022U
Following a mysterious missif warning of dire events and pleading for assistance found in the belongings of her missing love interest, a Lancer and mercenary known as Khepri, Latha Sarpy convinces Valencia Onatop, the owner of a moderately successful mercenary organization (and also Latha's older sister), to embark on a journey to a little known star system in search of answers.
Part way to their destination, the ship receives a mission offer from an unpublished Union navigation beacon. Authenticated and validated official Union Grade Mission offerings are good as gold.  The contract instantly turns the ship's blind journey through the dark into a profitable venture and the crew eagerly accepts the mission:  Search for a missing IPS-N heavy freighter, the UNS-L Flawless Victory and any other signs of abnormalities.  If violations of the Union's Utiopian Pillars are discovered, or Union forces are endangered, automatic follow-on contracts are available.

Now with a purpose, the crew set to the task of gathering information as they continued their journey.  Latha confirmed that several ships had passed this way in recent years, including one that is a likely match for The Naked Mole, Elio Pama's ship.  Xan researched the 'rediscovery' of Bright beginning with SecCom's scouring of the system and ending with the SecCom fleet being hunted down hundreds of years later.  Wilhelmina made contact with a research initiative known as The Transcendancy who is host to a variety of activities in the Bright system focused on finding answers to the system's many mysteries.  Valencia began fabricating and retrofitting the ship with a gravitic sensor array to better navigate the anomolies in the system.  With the (not always traditional) assistance of the crew, the array was in good working order before the ship arrived in system.

The Lancers worked on acquiring additional supplies for their departure to the surface, including procuring some experimental explosives, a core battery, and a harness for much less sophisticated but no less experimental explosives.

Now the Lancers make their final preperations before departing on an extended operation commencing with a daring open-space run through a storm of heavy ordinance...
